# steam-group

Simple node.js library for fetching Steam community group members.

## Installation

You can install this library using npm:
```
npm install steam-group
```

## Example Usage

Usage is simple. First, you need to create a group object:
```
var steamGroup = require('steam-group');

var group = steamGroup.fromName('fp_programmers');
// or
var group = steamGroup.fromId64('103582791430091926');
```

Once you have a group object, you can use several methods for retrieving member information:
```
// accepts callback(err, result)
// result is an array of 64-bit community ID strings
group.getMembers(callback);

// accepts callback(err, result)
// result is the 64-bit community ID string of the owner
group.getOwner(callback);

// same as group.getMembers
group.getOfficers(callback);
group.getModerators(callback);

// accepts callback(err, result)
// result is a boolean of whether or not the person is a member of this group
group.isMember(id, callback);

// accepts callback(err, result)
// result is either 'owner', 'officer', 'moderator', or 'member'
group.getMemberType(id, callback);
```

Group members are cached on the first use of the library (that is, the first time you use any of the functions). If you want to clear the cache without recreating the group object, you can use the clearCache function:
```
group.clearCache();
```
